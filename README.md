# Advanced Machine Learning

The course addresses the core issues in modern Artificial intelligence and Machine Learning: it covers the basic components of convolutional neural networks architectures and presents the evolution of deep learning models with an overview of the most relevant literature, finally focusing on advanced deep learning algorithms with Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing applications.

Students will learn what are the main properties of such techniques and how to design tailored approaches for specific case studies.

Lab activities will equip students with first-hand experience in modern optimization methods and programming frameworks most used in advanced research and companies.
